=======================================
Metrics specific to imbalanced learning
=======================================

Specific metrics have been developed to evaluate classifier which
has been trained using imbalanced data. :mod:`imbalanced_ensemble` provides mainly
two additional metrics which are not implemented in :mod:`sklearn`: (i)
geometric mean (:func:`imbalanced_ensemble.metrics.geometric_mean_score`) 
and (ii) index balanced accuracy (:func:`imbalanced_ensemble.metrics.make_index_balanced_accuracy`).

# We will create a pipeline made of a :class:`~imbalanced_ensemble.sampler.over_sampling.SMOTE`
# over-sampler followed by a :class:`~sklearn.svm.LinearSVC` classifier.

# Now, we will train the model on the training set and get the prediction
# associated with the testing set. Be aware that the resampling will happen
# only when calling `fit`: the number of samples in `y_pred` is the same than
# in `y_test`.

# The geometric mean corresponds to the square root of the product of the
# sensitivity and specificity. Combining the two metrics should account for
# the balancing of the dataset.
